[["index.html", "NYC crimes Chapter 1 Introduction", " NYC crimes Shumin, Xinhao, and Yuta 2022-12-13 Chapter 1 Introduction New York City, where we are living and studying, is one of the biggest and busiest cities in the world. The population is over 8 million as of 2021, which is largest of all cities in the United States, according to United States Census Bureau. However, the Big Apple is not only exciting but also infamous for the high crime rate, especially the hike after the COVID-19 pandemic. Actually, we can see horrible news on a crime almost everyday (it seems to be a hundred times more than my home country…). Our motivation for choosing this topic, NYC crimes, is here: in order to live in the city at ease, we are very curious about the crime data to understand what occurs. Through this project, we would like to clarify and answer questions below: what type of crimes occur the most/least; where crimes occur the most/least; what type of people are likely to be victims; do the characteristics above differ depending on the time the incident occurs (morning, daytime, night…); is there any trends or changes in terms of time series. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability 2.3 Data format", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic We chose “NYC crimes” as our topic, because, as a resident of New York City, we would like to utilize the result of our analysis to avoid dangerous situation as much as possible. Although crime data for other cities in the United State might be accessible, we rather focus on New York City in order not to go off the rails from the purpose. In this project, we clarify the characteristics of crimes and victims at a single point (cross-sectional) as well as time series trends. Specifically, we answer these questions below: what type of crimes occur the most/least; where crimes occur the most/least; what type of people are likely to be victims; do the characteristics above differ depending on the time the incident occurs; is there any trends or changes in terms of time series. Answering these questions will help us be safe, knowing how I am likely to be at risk and avoiding dangerous places and times. 2.2 Data availability In order to find appropriate answers for our research questions, we choose “NYPD Complaint Data Current(Year To Date)” dataset from NYC Open Data website as our main data source to analyze. The URL of this dataset is https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243 . This dataset contains all valid felony, misdemeanor and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department(NYPD), which demonstrates the reliability and authority of the data. The dataset is in CSV file format and it is updated by NYPD quarterly. So far, this dataset collects consecutive records starting from 1972 to 2022, which allow us to investigate changes of total number of crime reports with time and proportion of different types of crimes in each year. One crucial reason why we select this data source is that NYPD provides numerous accurate reports with detailed and various descriptions. The raw dataset contains approximately 400,000 crime records with 36 variable categories in total. There are many descriptive variables such as exact date of occurrence for the reported event, level of offense including felony, misdemeanor and violation, description of offense, suspect’s age and race group, etc. Supported by these variables of each observation, we can select and analyze data and illustrative information related to our research questions. For example, we need to filter out level of offense as well as description of offense categories in answering question “what type of crimes occur the most/least in NYC”. Nevertheless, there are some unimportant variables for our research questions. For example, the exact time of occurrence for the reported event time within a particular day, the name of the patrol borough in which the crime incident occurred and precise physical coordinates of location where reported event occurred. Further, it contains many null/NA values for many observations and unknown values for some observations. For instance, the age and race of suspect could be “unknown” in the dataset. Therefore, we need to remove unnecessary variables and modify the null values in data cleaning process. The Socrata Open Data API (SODA) provides programmatic access to this data set including the ability to filter, query, and aggregate data. To download the data in R, we can register an account on NYC Open Data to create an app_token and access the data with Socrata Open Data API, which is a package called RSocrata in R. Once we download the dataset, we can save it locally and load it every time we analyze the data. 2.3 Data format colname description types CMPLNT_NUM Randomly generated persistent ID for each complaint Plain Text ADDR_PCT_CD The precinct in which the incident occurred Number BORO_NM The name of the borough in which the incident occurred Plain Text CMPLNT_FR_DT Exact date of occurrence for the reported event (or starting date of occurrence, if CMPLNT_TO_DT exists) Date &amp; Time CMPLNT_FR_TM Exact time of occurrence for the reported event (or starting time of occurrence, if CMPLNT_TO_TM exists) Plain Text CMPLNT_TO_DT Ending date of occurrence for the reported event, if exact time of occurrence is unknown Date &amp; Time CMPLNT_TO_TM Ending time of occurrence for the reported event, if exact time of occurrence is unknown Plain Text CRM_ATPT_CPTD_CD Indicator of whether crime was successfully completed or attempted, but failed or was interrupted prematurely Plain Text HADEVELOPT Name of NYCHA housing development of occurrence, if applicable Plain Text HOUSING_PSA Development Level Code Number JURISDICTION_CODE Jurisdiction responsible for incident.

In this section, we want to do some cleaning and transformation to the raw dataset to make it tidy. We transform the type of columns to match it’s description. For example, we transform the type of ADDR_PCT_CD to numeric, as it describes the precinct in which the incident occurred. Also, we transform the type of CMPLNT_FR_DT into date, as it describes exact date of occurrence for the reported event. We drop the columns carrying the same information. For example, Lat_Lon.Latitude is exactly the same as Lat_Lon.Latitude, and Lat_Lon.Longitude is identical to Longitude. Moreover, New Georeferenced Column is just the combination of Latitude and Longitude. Therefore, we drop Lat_Lon and New Georeferenced Column in our dataset. we drop the unreasonable rows. For example, there are crimes starting at year 1011, which we believe is a mistake. In addition, in the suspect’s and victim’s ages, there are negative values. So we drop the rows with such mistakes. We factorize some variables. For example, ADDR_PCT_CD describes the precinct in which the incident occurred, so instead of integer, it should be factor. Moreover, some factors are ordinal, like LAW_CAT_CD, it describes the level of offense: felony, misdemeanor, violation, and SUSP_AGE_GROUP, which is the suspect’s age group. After cleaning and transforming, the description and the class of each column is shown in the table below: Colname Description Class ADDR_PCT_CD The precinct in which the incident occurred factor BORO_NM The name of the borough in which the incident occurred factor CMPLNT_FR_DT Exact date of occurrence for the reported event (or starting date of occurrence, if CMPLNT_TO_DT exists) Date CMPLNT_FR_TM Exact time of occurrence for the reported event (or starting time of occurrence, if CMPLNT_TO_TM exists) character CMPLNT_NUM Randomly generated persistent ID for each complaint character CMPLNT_TO_DT Ending date of occurrence for the reported event, if exact time of occurrence is unknown Date CMPLNT_TO_TM Ending time of occurrence for the reported event, if exact time of occurrence is unknown character CRM_ATPT_CPTD_CD Indicator of whether crime was successfully completed or attempted, but failed or was interrupted prematurely factor HADEVELOPT Name of NYCHA housing development of occurrence, if applicable factor HOUSING_PSA Development Level Code factor JURIS_DESC Description of the jurisdiction code factor JURISDICTION_CODE Jurisdiction responsible for incident.

Since each of these two variables has more than 300k NA values, which is more than 92% of total observations in dataset, and we only focus on where did a crime occur, we can drop these two variables in our result analysis part.Similarly, variable PARKS_NM, HOUSING_PSA, HADEVELOP have a positive correlation. This means if an observation has NA value in one of these three variables, then there is high probability that such observation will have NA values in other two variables. Since each of these three variables has more than 300k NA values and they are not related to our research questions, we will remove these variables in result analysis part. In bar chart of number of NA values, variable SUSP_SEX, SUSP_RACE, SUSP_AGE_GROUP have same number of NA values of 73511, so they are having a positive correlation = 1. This means if an observation has NA value in one of these three variables, then this observation record will have NA values in other two variables. Since we only focus on victims attributes in our research questions, we will remove these three variables in result analysis. Similarly, variable CMPLNT_TO_TM, CMPLNT_TO_DT have same number of NA values of 29262. They have a positive correlation = 1. Since we are only focus on occurred date of crimes, we will not select these 2 variables in our result analysis. In bar chart of number of NA values, there are ADDR_PCT_CD, BORO_NM, OFNS_DESC, PATROL_BORO, PD_CD, PD_DESC, PREM_TYP_DESC, VIC_RACE, X_COORD_CD, Y_COORD_CD, Geocoded_Column.type variables having NA values that are less than 1k. We will directly delete observations with NA values in these variables in our result analysis since total number of such observations only occupy approximately 0.5% of all data. In bar chart of number of Unknown values, variable VIC_RACE and VIC_AGE_GROUP have a strong positive correlation. VIC_RACE has 119.927k Unknown values while VIC_AGE_GROUP has 111.822k Unknown values, both of them occupy more than 28% of total observations. We will delete observations with Unknown values in making graphs of victim race and victim age group distribution over different areas of NYC. However, since there is a moderate portion of Unknown values in these two variables and we need to show that remaining data is not biased, we will make a bar chart to show distribution of observations with Unknown values in VIC_RACE and VIC_AGE_GROUP over boroughs of NYC. In bar chart of number of Unknown values, variable SUSP_RACE, SUSP_AGE_GROUP have a strong positive correlation. Since each of these two variables has more than 99k Unknown values and we only focus on victims attributes in our research questions, we will remove these three variables in result analysis. In bar chart of number of Unknown values, variable PD_DESC has 1221 Unknown values. Since this just occupy less than 0.5% of total data, we will directly remove observations with Unknown values in PD_DESC in our result analysis. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Time series analysis 4.2 Geographic Analysis", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Time series analysis The majority of the recorded crime in this dataset is happened in 2022 (&gt;97%). Therefore, we focus on the time series analysis in 2022. Because of the release date of the dataset, we only have data before October. Year Count &lt;2022 10113 2022 386739 4.1.1 Occurence Analysis We can see from the above plot that the number of crimes in 2022 from January to October goes gradually up then down. It indicates that the number of crimes may have a positive correlation to the temperature. When weather is warmer, there tends to be more crimes. This plot shos the occurrence of crime at difference times of the day in 2022. The occurrence of crime reaches to its lowest in the morning then gradually goes up. It reaches its peak at 3-5 p.m. then goes down. It’s against to our intuitation that most crime occurs at night. In fact, most of the crime occurs in the daytime, especially in the afternoon. 4.1.2 Law Category Analysis The plot shows the occurrence of crime falling in different law categories in 2022. We can see from the plot the occurrence in decreasing number is misdemeanor, felony and violation. They all experience an increase and decrease in trend of occurrence in 2022. Moreover, occurrence of misdemeanor has the highest variance while the occurrence of violation is the most stable among the occurrences of these three kinds of crimes. The above graph shows the crimes of all three categories reaches their lowest points at 5-6 a.m.. And they reaches their highest points at 3-5 p.m.. We can also see from the plot that in the night, there is another peak for felony and the rate of felony in all categories of crimes goes up. It’s to our intuition that the felony often occur at midnight. 4.2 Geographic Analysis 4.2.1 Analysis for whole area of NYC To create and discuss geographic visualization, we use the crime data only for the recent 10 years, that is, between 2013 and 2022, because we are interested in the current crime situation in the NYC and the situation might change dramatically if a few decades have passed. Maps above show that the areas where crimes were likely to occur varied according to the victim’s characteristics such as age, sex and race. Specifically, crimes against Asian people tended to occur near Flushing as well as Midtown Manhattan, which is probably because there is a big China town in Flushing and thus many Asian people visit there, while Black Hispanic people was likely to get involved in a crime in Bronx. In terms of victim’s gender and age, many young (less than 18) female and male victims in Bronx might draw your attention in particular. We presume that this is because assault and sexual crimes occurred more frequently in Bronx than in other borough (it is explained by an interactive visualization next chapter), and also because teenagers were more likely to suffered from those types of crimes, as the mosaic plot above shows. This mosaic plot also tells us that the older a victim was, the more likely he/she got involved in a robbery or theft, which we can intuitively understand the reason since the older people cannot move fast and thus will tend to be targeted by thieves. Besides, we can see from this plot that elderly people will be more easily deceived, resulting in the higher proportion of fraud incidents than yonger age groups. Although we can find a bunch of findings from these visualization, according to our objective and interest, we focus on the data near the campus of Columbia University and try to find some findings. 4.2.2 Analysis for the area near Columbia University We zoomed in on the map and created a heat map again so that we can find where is dangerous near our campus. As a result, more crimes seems to occur in the area more than 3 blocks away from the campus than just around the corner. In particular, we should be careful if we go around the 125th street Amsterdam Avenue and in the east side of Morningside Park. Next, we filtered the dataset into only crimes occurred near Columbia campus, and created a mosaic plot. This graph provides us with the information that the 18-24 year-old group, most of whom might be students, was suffer from robbery and theft the most frequently all day long. Although the percentage of each type of crime is almost the same between female and male of the 18-24 group, it seems that the proportion of assault incidents for female groups is slightly higher than male groups. Moreover, since we can find that the female 18-24 group has much higher proportion of sexual crime than other groups (even the “others” female group), especially midnight (12AM-6AM), they should not walk outside alone late at night. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component We created an interactive heat map in order to show where crimes occur the most/least, and what if we choose a crime type. The interactivity will help you explore the viz/data more flexibly and promptly. The link to the visualization is here. Specifically, the visualization is based on the NYC crime data between 2013 and 2022. This visualization provides you with interactive experiences in the following way: - Initially, you will see a heat map for the total number of all types of crime. - If you click one bar on the bar chart by crime type, the heat map on the left will change so that the based data is limited to the crime type you choose, as well as the color changes. - If you hover the cursor over the map, the corresponding precinct number, the crime type and the number of crime incidents are displayed. - You can reset the heatmap to the initial state by clicking “Reset” button. Seeing in detail, Murder, Assault and Sexual crime have the similar pattern of the crime frequency by area that Bronx and the outskirts of Brooklyn and Queens have the high frequency of those types of incidents, while Robbery and Harassment equally occurred almost everywhere. Fraud has a totally different pattern from murder incidents, which we think is because the characteristic of suspects might be different. &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt; .modal { display: none;
