[["index.html", "NYC crimes Chapter 1 Introduction", " NYC crimes Shumin, Xinhao, and Yuta 2022-11-28 Chapter 1 Introduction New York City, where we are living and studying, is one of the biggest and busiest cities in the world. The population is over 8 million as of 2021, which is largest of all cities in the United States, according to United States Census Bureau. However, the Big Apple is not only exciting but also infamous for the high crime rate, especially the hike after the COVID-19 pandemic. Actually, we can see horrible news on a crime almost everyday (it seems to be a hundred times more than my home country…). Our motivation for choosing this topic, NYC crimes, is here: in order to live in the city at ease, we are very curious about the crime data to understand what occurs. Through this project, we would like to clarify and answer questions below: what type of crimes occur the most/least; where crimes occur the most/least; what type of people are likely to be victims; do the characteristics above differ depending on the time the incident occurs (morning, daytime, night…); is there any trends or changes in terms of time series. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability 2.3 Data format", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic We chose “NYC crimes” as our topic, because, as a resident of New York City, we would like to utilize the result of our analysis to avoid dangerous situation as much as possible. Although crime data for other cities in the United State might be accessible, we rather focus on New York City in order not to go off the rails from the purpose. In this project, we clarify the characteristics of crimes and victims at a single point (cross-sectional) as well as time series trends. Specifically, we answer these questions below: what type of crimes occur the most/least; where crimes occur the most/least; what type of people are likely to be victims; do the characteristics above differ depending on the time the incident occurs; is there any trends or changes in terms of time series. Answering these questions will help us be safe, knowing how I am likely to be at risk and avoiding dangerous places and times. 2.2 Data availability In order to find appropriate answers for our research questions, we choose “NYPD Complaint Data Current(Year To Date)” dataset from NYC Open Data website as our main data source to analyze. The URL of this dataset is https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243 . This dataset contains all valid felony, misdemeanor and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department(NYPD), which demonstrates the reliability and authority of the data. The dataset is in CSV file format and it is updated by NYPD quarterly. So far, this dataset collects consecutive records starting from 1972 to 2022, which allow us to investigate changes of total number of crime reports with time and proportion of different types of crimes in each year. One crucial reason why we select this data source is that NYPD provides numerous accurate reports with detailed and various descriptions. The raw dataset contains approximately 400,000 crime records with 36 variable categories in total. There are many descriptive variables such as exact date of occurrence for the reported event, level of offense including felony, misdemeanor and violation, description of offense, suspect’s age and race group, etc. Supported by these variables of each observation, we can select and analyze data and illustrative information related to our research questions. For example, we need to filter out level of offense as well as description of offense categories in answering question “what type of crimes occur the most/least in NYC”. Nevertheless, there are some unimportant variables for our research questions. For example, the exact time of occurrence for the reported event time within a particular day, the name of the patrol borough in which the crime incident occurred and precise physical coordinates of location where reported event occurred. Further, it contains many null/NA values for many observations and unknown values for some observations. For instance, the age and race of suspect could be “unknown” in the dataset. Therefore, we need to remove unnecessary variables and modify the null values in data cleaning process. The Socrata Open Data API (SODA) provides programmatic access to this data set including the ability to filter, query, and aggregate data. To download the data in R, we can register an account on NYC Open Data to create an app_token and access the data with Socrata Open Data API, which is a package called RSocrata in R. Once we download the dataset, we can save it locally and load it every time we analyze the data. 2.3 Data format colname description types CMPLNT_NUM Randomly generated persistent ID for each complaint Plain Text ADDR_PCT_CD The precinct in which the incident occurred Number BORO_NM The name of the borough in which the incident occurred Plain Text CMPLNT_FR_DT Exact date of occurrence for the reported event (or starting date of occurrence, if CMPLNT_TO_DT exists) Date &amp; Time CMPLNT_FR_TM Exact time of occurrence for the reported event (or starting time of occurrence, if CMPLNT_TO_TM exists) Plain Text CMPLNT_TO_DT Ending date of occurrence for the reported event, if exact time of occurrence is unknown Date &amp; Time CMPLNT_TO_TM Ending time of occurrence for the reported event, if exact time of occurrence is unknown Plain Text CRM_ATPT_CPTD_CD Indicator of whether crime was successfully completed or attempted, but failed or was interrupted prematurely Plain Text HADEVELOPT Name of NYCHA housing development of occurrence, if applicable Plain Text HOUSING_PSA Development Level Code Number JURISDICTION_CODE Jurisdiction responsible for incident.

In this section, we want to do some cleaning and transformation to the raw dataset to make it tidy. We transform the type of columns to match it’s description. For example, we transform the type of ADDR_PCT_CD to numeric, as it describes the precinct in which the incident occurred. Also, we transform the type of CMPLNT_FR_DT into date, as it describes exact date of occurrence for the reported event. We drop the columns carrying the same information. For example, Lat_Lon.Latitude is exactly the same as Lat_Lon.Latitude, and Lat_Lon.Longitude is identical to Longitude. Moreover, New Georeferenced Column is just the combination of Latitude and Longitude. Therefore, we drop Lat_Lon and New Georeferenced Column in our dataset. we drop the unreasonable rows. For example, there are crimes starting at year 1011, which we believe is a mistake. In addition, in the suspect’s and victim’s ages, there are negative values. So we drop the rows with such mistakes. We factorize some variables. For example, ADDR_PCT_CD describes the precinct in which the incident occurred, so instead of integer, it should be factor. Moreover, some factors are ordinal, like LAW_CAT_CD, it describes the level of offense: felony, misdemeanor, violation, and SUSP_AGE_GROUP, which is the suspect’s age group. After cleaning and transforming, the description and the class of each column is shown in the table below: Colname Description Class ADDR_PCT_CD The precinct in which the incident occurred factor BORO_NM The name of the borough in which the incident occurred factor CMPLNT_FR_DT Exact date of occurrence for the reported event (or starting date of occurrence, if CMPLNT_TO_DT exists) Date CMPLNT_FR_TM Exact time of occurrence for the reported event (or starting time of occurrence, if CMPLNT_TO_TM exists) character CMPLNT_NUM Randomly generated persistent ID for each complaint character CMPLNT_TO_DT Ending date of occurrence for the reported event, if exact time of occurrence is unknown Date CMPLNT_TO_TM Ending time of occurrence for the reported event, if exact time of occurrence is unknown character CRM_ATPT_CPTD_CD Indicator of whether crime was successfully completed or attempted, but failed or was interrupted prematurely factor HADEVELOPT Name of NYCHA housing development of occurrence, if applicable factor HOUSING_PSA Development Level Code factor JURIS_DESC Description of the jurisdiction code factor JURISDICTION_CODE Jurisdiction responsible for incident.
