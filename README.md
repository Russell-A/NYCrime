This repository is set up for the final project of EDAV.

The project is about the crime happened in New York City. We gather the data from NYC Open Data. The data include the crime happened from 2000 in NYC. We clean the data and perform EDAV on the data. We aim to answer the following questions: 

* what type of crimes occur the most/least;
* where crimes occur the most/least;
* what type of people are likely to be victims;
* do the characteristics above differ depending on the time the incident occurs;
* is there any trends or changes in terms of time series.

The report for this project is available online [here](https://russell-a.github.io/NYCrime/). It includes the introduction, the proposal, the data, the analysis of the data, an interactive part and the conclusion.

The interactive part is base on D3. You can visit it on [this website](https://yuta555.github.io) or visit it through the hyperlink provided in the interactive part in the book.
