# Proposal

## Research topic

We chose "NYC crimes" as our topic, because, as a resident of New York
City, we would like to utilize the result of our analysis to avoid
dangerous situation as much as possible. Although crime data for other
cities in the United State might be accessible, we rather focus on New
York City in order not to go off the rails from the purpose.

In this project, we clarify the characteristics of crimes and victims at
a single point (cross-sectional) as well as time series trends.
Specifically, we answer these questions below:

-   what type of crimes occur the most/least;

-   where crimes occur the most/least;

-   what type of people are likely to be victims;

-   do the characteristics above differ depending on the time the incident occurs;

-   is there any trends or changes in terms of time series.


## Data availability

The Socrata Open Data API (SODA) provides programmatic access to this dataset including the ability to filter, query, and aggregate data.

As the dataset is available on NYC Open Data, we can register an account and create an app_token.to accesss the data with Socrata Open Data API.

Install the required package with:
install.packages("RSocrata")
Download Data with:
library("RSocrata")
df <- read.socrata(
  "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/5uac-w243.json",
  app_token = "vIJ4xFjA2E86HXCxu41t3VDIy",
  email     = "****",
  password  = "****"
)
For safety reason, the email and password is concealed.


```{r save data}
## save dataset in local fold
# save(df,file="./dataset/rawdata.Rda")

## load local dataset
load("./dataset/rawdata.Rda")
```
