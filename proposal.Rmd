# Proposal

## Research topic

## Data availability
In order to find appropriate answers for our research questions, we choose "NYPD Complaint Data Current(Year To Date)" dataset from NYCOpenData website as our main data source to analyze.This dataset contains all valid felony, misdemeanor and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department(NYPD) starting consecutively from 1972 to 2022. 


The Socrata Open Data API (SODA) provides programmatic access to this dataset including the ability to filter, query, and aggregate data.

As the dataset is available on NYC Open Data, we can register an account and create an app_token.to accesss the data with Socrata Open Data API.

Install the required package with:
install.packages("RSocrata")
Download Data with:
library("RSocrata")
df <- read.socrata(
  "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/5uac-w243.json",
  app_token = "vIJ4xFjA2E86HXCxu41t3VDIy",
  email     = "****",
  password  = "****"
)
For safety reason, the email and password is concealed.


```{r save data}
## save dataset in local fold
# save(df,file="./dataset/rawdata.Rda")

## load local dataset
load("./dataset/rawdata.Rda")
```
